this code was written with the limits of the code.org JavaScript editor for the Create PT for APCSP in 2022.

the getMorse function translates the given english message into a morse message.
completeMsg is continually grown with every completed word, finalizing once the function repeats for as many times as there are characters in the given message "msg1".

the files in this folder contain everything you need to run this app. do with that as you will :)
